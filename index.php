			<p>
				I am a Junior at the University of Rochester double majoring in Computer Science and Digital Media Studies, which provides the unique intersection of engineering and creative arts. Studying to be a software engineer, my academic and professional experience has given me a strong understanding of both the technical and user experience sides of a product.
