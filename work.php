		<h1>WORK</h1>

		<p>
			During my short career as a computer scientist I have worked at two different startups: Shareaholic and Drift. Both of the Boston based companies develop web applications. Shareaholic main product is a toolbar widget that different websites can install which allow there visitors to share their content on their social media. This one-click model can share to a variety of social media sites, catering to all different parts of the world. My time spent at Shareaholic was as a “Publisher Support Analyst”– which mainly functioned in the customer support role. I had the unique opportunity to solve problems, optimize the support process of the company, communicate directly with clients, as well as get my hands on some data analytics and advertising. Drift is a messaging application for sales and marketing. Instead of the traditional nurturing cycle of leads, Drift uses AI to instant qualifies and routes leads the the appropriate sales representative or automatically communicates with the customer. While at Drift I worked as a “Customer Advocate” working as a bridge between Support and Product teams. I had the opportunity to not only work directly with customers and engineers, but also to tackle independent projects and take ownership of the company’s “triage” process. I hope to work as a software engineer this upcoming summer and continue my professional development.

			I also have worked on campus. I am currently a Meridian, aka a tour guide. I give both regular and engineering campus tours. I have also previously worked as a TA for the department of computer science.
